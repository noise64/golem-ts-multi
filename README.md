# Golem TypeScript Example with Multiple Components and Worker to Worker RPC Communication

## Building

The project uses a custom Typescript build file: [build.ts](build.ts), ran through [tsx](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/nodejs-with-typescript#running-typescript-code-with-tsx). The `build.ts` file handles **generating stubs**, **building**, **deploying** and **testing**; and also handles _"up to date" checks_ based on _modification times_. Build commands can be run using `npx tsx build.ts <command>` (or without _npx_, if _tsx_ is available globally), but all commands have `npm run <command>` wrappers, in the examples we will use the latter.

To see the available commands use:

```shell
npm run help

> help
> npx tsx build.ts

Available commands:
  fmt:                  format using prettier
  lint:                 lint project using eslint
  fix:                  format, lint and fix project using eslint
  build:                build all components
  updateRpcStubs:       update stubs based on componentDependencies
  generateNewComponent: generates new component from template, expects <component-name>
  deploy:               deploy (create or update) all components
  deployComponent:      deploy (create or update) the specified component, expects <component-name>
  test:                 run tests
  clean:                clean outputs and generated code
```

For building the project for the first time (or after `clean`) use the following commands:

```shell
npm install
npm run updateRpcStubs
npm run build
```

After this, using the `build` command is enough, unless there are changes in the RPC dependencies,
in that case `updateRpcStubs` is needed again.

Note that multiple commands can be used in one invocation (if they do not have parameters), e.g.:

```shell
npm run updateRpcStubs build
```

The final components that are usable by golem are placed in the `out/components` folder.

## Deploying and testing the example

In the example 3 simple counter components are defined, which can be familiar from the smaller examples. To showcase the remote calls, the counters `add` functions are connected, apart from increasing their own counter:

- **component one** delegates the add call to **component two** and **three** too,
- and **component two** delegates to **component three**.

In both cases the _current worker name_ will be used as _target worker name_ too.

Apart from _worker name_, remote calls also require the **target components' deployed ID**. For this the example uses environment variables, and uses the `lib/cfg` subpackage (which is shared between the components) to extract it.

The examples assume a configured default `golem-cli` profile, and will use that.

To test, first we have to build the project as seen in the above:

```shell
npm run updateRpcStubs build
```

Then we can deploy our components with `golem-cli`, for which a wrapper command is provided:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Note that `npm run deployComponent <component-name>` can be used to deploy (or update) only one component.

Once the components are deployed, a simple example integration test suite can be used to test the components.

Note that after deploy it might still take some time for the components to be prepared inside golem, which for TypeScript can take about 30-50 seconds, so invoking workers or running the tests immediately after deploy might have to wait for this preparation.

Once the components are deployed, a simple example integration test suite can be used to test the components.
The tests are in the [/test/integration.test.ts](/test/integration.test.ts) test file, and can be run with:

```shell
npm run test
```

The first test simply tests if our components metadata is available through `golem-cli component get`.

The second test will:

- get the _component URNs_ with `golem-cli component get`
- generates a _random worker name_, so our tests are starting from a clean state
- adds 1 - 1 worker for component one and component two with the required _environment variables_ containing the other workers' _component ids_
- then makes various component invocations with `golem-cli worker invoke-and-await` and tests if the counters - after increments - are holding the right value according to the delegated `add` function calls.

## Adding Components

Use the `generateNewComponent` command to add new components to the project:

```shell
npm run generateNewComponent component-four
```

The above will create a new component in the `src/components/component-four` directory based on the template at [/component-template/component](/component-template/component).

After adding a new component the `build` command will also include it.

## Using Worker to Worker RPC calls

### Under the hood

Under the hood the `build.ts` commands below use generic `golem-cli stubgen` subcommands:

- `golem-cli stubgen build` for creating remote call _stub WIT_ definitions and _WASM components_ for the stubs
- `golem-cli stubgen add-stub-dependency` for adding the _stub WIT_ definitions to a _component's WIT_ dependencies
- `golem-cli stubgen compose` for _composing_ components with the stub components

### Commands and required manual steps

The dependencies between components are defined in the [build.ts](build.ts) build script:

```typescript
// Defines worker to worker RPC dependencies
const componentDependencies: Dependencies = {
  "component-one": ["component-two", "component-three"],
  "component-two": ["component-three"],
};
```

After changing dependencies the `updateRpcStubs` command can be used to create the necessary stubs:

```shell
npm run updateRpcStubs
```

The command will create stubs for the dependency projects in the `/out/stub` directory and will also place the required stub _WIT_ interfaces on the dependant component's `wit/deps` directory.

To actually use the dependencies in a project it also has to be manually imported in the component's world.

E.g. with the above definitions the following import has to be **manually** added to `/components/component-one/wit/component-one.wit`:

```wit
import pack-ns:component-two-stub;
import pack-ns:component-three-stub;
```

So the component definition should like similar to this:

```wit
package pack-ns:component-one;

// See https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html for more details about the WIT syntax

interface component-one-api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world component-one {
  // Golem dependencies
  import golem:api/host@0.2.0;
  import golem:rpc/types@0.1.0;

  // WASI dependencies
  import wasi:blobstore/blobstore;
  // .
  // .
  // .
  // other dependencies
  import wasi:sockets/instance-network@0.2.0;

  // Project Component dependencies
  import pack-ns:component-two-stub;
  import pack-ns:component-three-stub;

  export component-one-api;
}
```

After this `build` command can be used to update bindings, which now should include the
required functions for calling other components.

Here's an example that delegates the `Add` call to another component and waits for the result:

```go
import {ComponentTwoApi} from "./generated/component-two";
import {ComponentThreeApi} from "golem:component-three-stub/stub-component-three";

let state = BigInt(0);

export const componentTwoApi: ComponentTwoApi = {
  add(value: bigint) {
    console.log(`Adding ${value} to the counter`);

    console.log("Calling component three");
    const componentThree = new ComponentThreeApi({value: "urn"});
    componentThree.blockingAdd(value);

    state += value;
  },
  get() {
    return state;
  }
};
```

Once a remote call is in place, the `build` command will also compose the stub components into the caller component.
